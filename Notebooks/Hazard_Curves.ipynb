    "# Hazard Curves for PTHA\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (PTHA) is often to create a hazard map that shows what regions of a community are most at risk and that indicates in some manner the annual probability that inundation will occur above some level in these regions.  Another notebook will be developed to illustrate various such maps and how the are constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key ingredient in making any such map is the *hazard curve* computed at many geographical locations (typically at each point on some grid of points covering the community of interest).  The focus in this notebook is understanding how one such hazard curve is constructed.  So we are considering a fixed geographic location and looking at the probability that the maximum inundation depth exceeds some value $h$ as $h$ varies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this probability $P(h)$ will be a non-increasing function of $h$, i.e., if $h_1 < h_2$ then $P(h_1) \\geq P(h_2)$ since any event that inundates above depth $h_2$ also inundates above depth $h_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that $P(0)$ is the annual probability that there is inundation deeper than $h=0$, i.e., the probability that there is any flooding at all.  If $P(0) = 0$ then $P(h) = 0$ for all $h>0$ and this is a point that has 0 probability of ever getting wet, i.e., it is completely out of any possible inundation zone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If $P(0) > 0.01$ at this point then the annual probability is greater than $0.01$ that this point will get wet.  Such a point is sometimes said to be in the 100-year flood zone."

    "\n",
    "First we consider the simplest case where only one possible event might occur,  say with annual probability $p_1 = 0.001$ (i.e., with a 1000-year return time).  Recall that we are considering some particular fixed location in the community of interest, and suppose our tsunami simulation shows that the maximum depth of inundation at this point will be $h_1 = 1.5 m$ if this event occurs (measured in meters of water depth).  Then we can plot the annual probability $P(h)$ that flooding will exceed the value $h$ as a function of $h$ (the exceedance value).  This is a simple piecewise constant function since $P(h) = p_1$ for any $h < h_1$ and $P(h) = 0$ for any $h > h_1$.  This plot is shown below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since we are dealing with very small probabilities and it is important to distinguish between values like 0.01 (100-year flood) and 0.001 (1000-year flood), it is best to plot this using a logarithmic scale in $p$.  We do this in the plots on the left below.  Note that for all $h>h_1 = 1.5$ in the plot below, the function value $P(h) = 0$ does not show up since $\\log(0) = -\\infty$.   \n",

    "The plot above is the hazard curve if we assume only one possible event might happen.  What if there are two possible earthquakes that could happen, each of which would cause flooding to different maximum depths, call them $h_1$ and $h_2$.  The events might also have different annual probabilities of occurring, call these $p_1$ and $p_2$.  We will assume that they are independent, meaning that if one happens or not has no effect on whether the other occurs.  This is a good assumption if one event is a potential earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone and the other is a potential earthquake on a different subduction zone.  It is perhaps less justified if the two events are two different possible earthquakes in the same place.  The occurrance of one Magnitude 9 earthquake on CSZ might eliminate the possibility of another M9 event, or it might increase the occurance of an M8 event as an aftershock.  But we will not consider this more complicated case and assume that they are independent events.\n",
